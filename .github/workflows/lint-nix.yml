# This yml handles linting nix configs for each PR
### Workflow
# 1. Developer writes nix configs
# 2. Developer pushes code up to fork and opens new PR
# 3. This job kicks off, verifying the new configuration they added
# 4. If the job suceeds, the PR is allowed to be merged. If not, the PR is unable to be merged
