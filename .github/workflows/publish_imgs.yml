# nix-garage GitHub Actions Workflow for publishing images to Docker Hub

### Workflow
# 1. We want this to be ran manually i.e. with a comment in a PR. To do this, we can have a release process where we update what is currently out in prod via a PR
# 2. Once the PR is made, we then have someone (who is an approver) comment in the PR "Publish Images" (WIP)
# 3. GitHub Actions will detect this comment being made, and check if the comment was made by an approved person, alongside what they commented.
# 4. If it matches, we fire off this job, where we log into docker.io with nwiauto (also pass in the password via a secret declared in the repo)
# 5. Once we logged in, we then execute the script "publish-imgs", which will publish the image passed into it.
# 6. If successful, the job will create a new PR comment saying all of the images that were published as well as a link to the page with all of the images
